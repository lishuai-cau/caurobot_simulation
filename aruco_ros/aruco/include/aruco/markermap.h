/**\brief This class defines a set of markers whose locations are attached to a common
 * reference system, i.e., they do not move wrt each other. A MarkerMap contains several
 * markers so that they are more robustly detected.
 *
 * A MarkerMap is only a list  of the id of the markers along with the position of their
 * corners. A MarkerMap may have information about the dictionary the markers belongs to
 * @see getDictionary()
 *
 * The position of the corners can be specified either in pixels (in a non-specific size)
 * or in meters. The first is the typical case in which you generate the image of  board
 * and the print it. Since you do not know in advance the real size of the markers, their
 * corners are specified in pixels, and then, the translation to meters can be made once
 * you know the real size.
 *
 * On the other hand, you may want to have the information of your boards in meters. The
 * MarkerMap allows you to do so.
 *
 * The point is in the mInfoType variable. It can be either PIX or METERS according to
 * your needs.
 *
